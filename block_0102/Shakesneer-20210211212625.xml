      <p>I lived once in Ohio, where casinos were illegal. The gambling industry tried for years to change the law, but were defeated every time. They lost in the legislature, in the ballot box, in referenda, again and again. They lost so many times they ran up against statutory limits that prevented them from raising another ballot initiative. But those plucky casino interests never gave up: they sponsored a constitutional amendment, which couldn't be time limited, then sold casinos as a job measure during the recession. It worked, casinos passed, and now that their side won, the People Have Spoken, it's Time To Move On.</p>
      <p>Sometimes it feels like only one side is allowed to win. Abortion was defeated a dozen times in Argentina, the EU was defeated a dozen times in the 20th century at the ballot, gay marriage was defeated here a dozen times in the last 20 years -- but then when the other side wins, The Matter Is Settled.</p>
