  <title>Kanye West and Sincerity</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think our culture lacks sincerity. As we retreat into ourselves, it becomes more difficult for us to express ourselves to other people. We lack intimacy and so crave it even more. The problem is that as we satisfy our own needs we become even fussier about letting other people satisfy those needs. Who else knows what I like as well as I do? So we spent more time alone at home, eating by ourselves, playing by ourselves, pleasuring ourselves, living by ourselves.</p>
      <p>I imagine it going something like this:</p>
      <p>"I want sincerity, real human emotion, to feel something real."
"Ok. I'm really Christian and I believe Jesus is King."
"No! Not like that!"</p>
      <p>It says a lot that we treat celebrities as reflections of ourselves, it <em>matters</em> that they dress and think and talk like us. Kanye serving up Godpills feels like a betrayal to many people because they thought they could see themselves in Kanye -- and now they can't. Of course, celebrities will always reflect the public at large, they have a <em>platform</em> to promote with, people will always get upset when this platform is used poorly, and many people no longer think Christianity is a good thing. So for these people there's a pragmatic sense of rejecting Kanye because he now promotes bad ideas. But if that was all it was: how would Kanye rank compared to other rappers? Would anyone bother?</p>
      <p>None of this is specific to Christians, you could just as easily apply this analysis to any other flash point. (Why does it matter if LeBron James does or does not support the current president?)</p>
      <p>But I would note that, when we Christians talk about feeling under attack by the culture, this is the kind of thing we're talking about.</p>
