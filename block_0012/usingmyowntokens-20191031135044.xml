  <title>Resasons for Opposing Open Borders</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>One of the problems with the border rhetoric is that in a lot of cases, the United States government heavily restricts one's rights to private property and freedom of association. Granted, there are good reasons for this (eg stopping segregation), but it is what it is. </p>
      <p>This has left a lot of people who might otherwise be supportive of more permissive borders in a bind. What do you do if, for example, you don't really care who lives in <em>America</em>, as long as <em>your community specifically</em>  retains the cultural characteristics that you grew up with? It is explicitly illegal to enforce retaining those characteristics in any way. And so, if you are (to use a concrete example) worried about feeling like an alien in your home neighbourhood as a million Mexicans move in, well, your <em>only</em> recourse is to stop them from entering the country in the first place. </p>
      <p>It would be better for <em>everyone</em> involved, if you could instead allow them to move into the United States while retaining your neighbourhood specifically as the (to use a concrete example) Serbian enclave that it is. But, for historical, path-dependent reasons, you are not allowed to do that.</p>
