  <title>Its Ok to be a White White Hat Troll</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Recently I've been thinking about a distinction between white-hat trolling and black-hat trolling. Black-hat trolling is trolling specifically for the purpose of causing distress. White-hat trolling is trolling for the sake of calling attention to bad behavior or sloppy thinking. Trolling for truth, justice, and the American Way.</p>
      <p>Depending on your political inclinations, you might classify John Stewart or P.J. O'Rourke as a white-hat troll. In D&amp;D terms, it's chaotic-good discourse. I'm not sure how effective it is (on the other hand, I'm not sure lawful-good discourse is particularly effective either), but it's definitely a thing.</p>
      <p>I see "It's okay to be white" as white-hat trolling. Yes, it causes distress, but the primary aim is to call out the toxicity of left-wing demonization of whiteness, such as using "whiteness" as a synonym for oppression as unselfconsciously as sixth-graders use "gay" as an all-purpose pejorative.</p>
