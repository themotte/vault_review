  <title>The Economic Collapse of the Midwest</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Forgive me, but I'm going to rant.  These kinds of articles drive me crazy.</p>
      <p>The factories in the Midwest began to close in the 1980’s, and the process terminally accelerated in the early 1990’s.  The economy of many towns in the region collapsed, the mom and pop stores were replaced by big boxes, and everyone who could find a way to escape the region did so, leading to an enormous brain drain.  The remaining population, disproportionately poor and living on disability, was then targeted by Purdue Pharmaceutical in 1996 for sale of its latest pain-relieving medication, which was sold – with supportive labeling by the FDA – as having little to no addictive potential.   This was a complete fabrication, and millions of people became addicted, which was fertile ground for franchised heroin dealers from Nayarit to move in over a porous southern border and begin turning pill addicts to heroin addicts, and even more recently, for Chinese-manufactured fentanyl.  Drug abuse and social decline then drive further economic regression in an ever-tightening spiral.</p>
      <p>All of this has been happening for decades.  The African American population in the rust belt has been hit just as hard economically as the white population, and when the white people in rust belt towns look at their black neighbors, they don't see anything to envy.  It's just that there aren't very many black people in these towns, so their stories don't get told, and their "deaths of despair" aren't heavy enough to weight the statistics.  To the extent that there's a racial angle here, it's that the Mexicans from Nayarit won't sell to black people because, well, <em>they're</em> racist.</p>
      <p>This story of socioeconomic collapse is entirely typical.  It’s exactly what happened to urban African Americans in the 1970’s-early 1990’s after white flight gutted urban economies until the process of re-urbanization began to rescue many American cities and their black populations a quarter century ago, about the time the decline was really starting to bite in the rust belt.</p>
      <p>If you live in a town on the Scioto river, it’s not racial disparities or the lack thereof that drives any sense of despair.  It’s the disparity between the way the town is now, and the way it was forty years ago when you were young, and having been present to watch that decline.</p>
      <p>The “racial status” narrative is a story that the professional managerial class or the salary class or whatever we’re calling them now, tells itself in order to avoid responsibility for pursuing – and continuing to pursue – the economic policies that have gutted so many former manufacturing towns and left those unable to escape the ruins to rot in them.  This isn’t surprising; the PMC has never come to terms with how it hollowed out American cities sixty years ago, either.  The bourgeoisie are ever vigilant for the speck in the eye of the working class, ever ignorant of the log in their own.</p>
      <p>Because the reality is, the PMC is beset on all sides with spiraling prices for higher education, prestigious real estate and other status goods, and the only thing that has allowed its members to sustain their standard of living under these pressures is to continuously push down the cost of manufactured products and labor through offshoring and immigration.  So the working class goes under the bus, and everyone in the PMC sings the Racist Racist song as loudly as possible to drown out the screams and thumping from the undercarriage.</p>
