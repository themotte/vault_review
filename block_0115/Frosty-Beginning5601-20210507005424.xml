  <title>"The CDC doesn't try to figure out what the optimal risk-reward or health-fun tradeoff is, they give advice about what the healthiest thing to do is and then everyone ignores it."</title>

      <p>I think Yglesias had the best take on this in "<a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/cdc-normal">Back to Normal Means Ignoring the CDC</a>" where he says that the normal function of the CDC is to give overly cautious health advice that everyone ignores. </p>
      <p>The CDC advises men should have at most two drinks, that women on birth control should have one, and women off birth control should never drink because they might be pregnant and not know it. They say all eggs should be cooked until the yolks are firm, and all steaks should be cooked to medium at a minimum.  The CDC doesn't try to figure out what the optimal risk-reward or health-fun tradeoff is, they give advice about what the healthiest thing to do is and then everyone ignores it. </p>
      <p>I don't think the current CDC/Fauci line about "Don't eat indoors even if you're vaccinated because there's still a small risk" requires explanation beyond the typical overly cautious standard the CDC adopts.</p>
